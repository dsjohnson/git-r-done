git-R-done | Using R, git and github to further reproducible science
====================================================================

## Today, you are NOT going to learn ... 

- R
- git
- github

## Today, you ARE going to learn ...

- About reproducible research in R
- How you might incorporate git into your scientific workflow
- How github enhances the transparency and openess of your science

## Learn to Tell a Story ... From the Beginning

1. Research Planning/Desing
2. Data Collection
3. Data Management and Munging
4. Data Analysis
5. Pretty Graphs/Pictures
6. **Presentations and Publications**

Version Control
========================================================

## Many of you already use a version control system without realizing it

- file/folder naming conventions
    * _myanalysis.R
    * _myanalysis-1.R
    * _myanalysis-20141103.R
    * _myanalysis-20141103-JML.R

- Google drive apps (docs, spreadsheet, presentations)

- MS Word Track Changes (ugh)


## Git Allows You to Tell a Story While Exploring

- branches = parallel dimensions

- commits = punchlines


Git Demonstration
=======================================================


## Using Git with R

Scientific analysis and R doesn't follow a typical software development cycle ... so don't force it to

- start with a single user and a single branch
- commit often and tell a story
- tags to mark milestones

## Using Git with R

As you get comfortable, branch out

- create a _develop_ branch
- _master_ branch always works
- simple branches off _develop_

Using Git with RStudio
=======================================================

## Resources for Learning Git


Collaborating with Git
======================================================

## Git Servers

## Pushing and Pulling

## Git Doesn't Replace Communication

## GitHub

## GitHub and the Federal Government

## Github at NOAA/NMFS ... or not?

## Fundamental Research Communication

## Scientific Integrity Policy

## Value GitHub as a Component in the Scientific Process

## Be Professional, Be Smart, Be Secure

## GitHub and the Publication Process

- GitHub is for hosting code and analysis
- Not a data archive (e.g. NODC, NGDC, Dryan, Figshare)
- Mozilla Science Lab/Figshare/GitHub for Minting DOI's

## You Will Not Learn Git Overnight

## Jump In with Both Feet

## Make Mistakes
